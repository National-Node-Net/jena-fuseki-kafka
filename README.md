# README  

**Repository:** `jena-fuseki-kafka`   
**Description:** `This repository provides an Apache Jena Fuseki extension module for receiving data over Apache Kafka topics. The module is used to read knowledge from a Kafka message stream typically as the final stage in a pipeline of data processing for ingest.`

## Overview  
This repository contributes to the development of **secure, scalable, and interoperable data-sharing infrastructure**. It supports NDTP’s mission to enable **trusted, federated, and decentralised** data-sharing across organisations.  

This repository is one of several open-source components that underpin NDTP’s **Integration Architecture (IA)**—a framework designed to allow organisations to manage and exchange data securely while maintaining control over their own information. The IA is actively deployed and tested across multiple sectors, ensuring its adaptability and alignment with real-world needs. 

For a complete overview of the Integration Architecture (IA) project, please see the [Integration Architecture Documentation](https://github.com/National-Node-Net/integration-architecture-documentation).

## Prerequisites  
Before using this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
- **Required Tooling:** 
    - Java 17
    - Github PAT token set to allow retrieval of maven packages from Github Packages
- **Pipeline Requirements:** 
    - Cloud platform credentials
- **Supported Kubernetes Versions:** N/A
- **System Requirements:** 
    - Java 17
    - Docker
    - Kafka (or connectivity to)

## Quick Start  
Follow these steps to get started quickly with this repository. For detailed installation, configuration, and deployment, refer to the relevant MD files.  

### 1. Download and Build  
```sh  
git clone https://github.com/National-Node-Net/jena-fuseki-kafka.git
cd jena-fuseki-kafka
```
### 2. Run Build Version  
This requires Java 17. Tests will currently fail if run on later Java versions. This also applies to `mvn test`
```sh  
mvn clean package

```

This creates a jar file `jena-fmod-kafka-VER.jar` in `jena-fmod-kafka/target/`.

Move this jar to 'lib/' in the directory you wish to run Fuseki with the Fuseki-Kafka connector.

Copy the bash script `fuseki-main` to the same directory.

_This includes running Apache Kafka via docker containers from `testcontainers.io`. There is a large, one time, download._

### 3. Usage

#### Standalone

In the directory where you wish to run Fuseki:

Get a copy of Fuseki Main:

```sh
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/jena/jena-fuseki-server/4.7.0/jena-fuseki-server-4.7.0.jar
```
and place in the current directory.

Get a copy of the script [fuseki-main](https://github.com/National-Node-Net/jena-fuseki-kafka/blob/main/fuseki-main)
then run 

```sh
fuseki-main jena-fuseki-server-4.7.0.jar --conf config.ttl
```

where `config.ttl` is the configuration file for the server including the
connector setup.

_Windows uses can run `fuseki-main.bat` which may need adjusting for the correct
version number of Fuseki._

#### Maven Project
To use the library directly in your project:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>uk.gov.dbt.ndtp.jena</groupId>
    <artifactId>jena-fuseki-kafka-module</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

_populate the `artifactId` above as appropriate._

### 4. Testing
You can run the test suite with
```sh
mvn test
```
Requires Java 17. There have been reports of failures when running on newer Java versions

## Testing Guide

### Running Unit Tests
Navigate to the root of the project and run `mvn test` to run the tests for the repository.
